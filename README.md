### The legendary codes that will change your future career FOREVER

The codes in the current repository are creative, useless, resource-wasteful, and hilarious. For example, let's suppose that we are going to add two integers. Then we would write codes like `num1 + num2` and it is general usage. For someone who learns codes, a function named `add()` would be created. However, the following code is also a (creative) way to successfully add two numbers.
```python
from time import sleep, time

# Add two numbers
def add(num1, num2):
	start = time()
	sleep(num1)
	sleep(num2)
	
	return int(time() - start)
```

It is funny and useless but anyway, it works(~~useless shit, right?~~). So I decided to collect codes like that, and this repository is for them.

### Want to contribute?
#### Hell Yeah!
You can submit codes in any programming language(For example, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Assembly, Brainf*ck, Perl, SQL, HTML(_is not a programming language but Github Linguistics still recognizes them, right?_), etc.)! They should just be useless, resource-wasteful, and fun. Of course, it would be much better if it were creative ~~or legendary~~. Just make **pull requests** today and contribute to this repository! Start your developers' career by contributing this **open source** ~~(but useless)~~ and learn how to use Github too!

- Please leave a simple comment in the code if you can.
- When you submit a code, please comply with the conventional file name. (ex. camelcase, snake case)
- When there is no appropriate directory for your language, you can request or manually create the language folder. But please use lowercase when you name a folder. (ex. `Assembly`, `ASSEMBLY`, `assEMbLy`, or `A$$EMBLY`(_I don't know such a thing is possible._) are not acceptable. `assembly` is acceptable.)
- You can also submit illegible codes like brainf*ck freely. However, please attach more detailed explanations of what this code means or why it is funny. (add more context)

### Is it reasonable to use the shitty code in your program?
Generally not, it is just for fun. However... there are still lots of companies that measure the internal personnel's ability as lines of codes written by them per day. In these unfortunate cases, you should be inspired to create some shits that exaggerate code lines. To accomplish those missions, this repository would be helpful.

### Have any questions?
No one can sustain their lives without question. Questions are welcomed except for the truthful meaning of this repository's existence. If you have any questions, just feel free to make issues on the `Issues` tab!
