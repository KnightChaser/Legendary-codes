### The legendary codes that will change your future career

The codes in the current repository are creative, useless, resource-wasteful, and hilarious. For example, let's suppose that we are going to add two integers. then we would write codes like `num1 + num2` and it is general usage. For someone who learns codes, a function named `add()` would be created. However, the following code is also a (creative) way to successfully add two numbers.
```python
from time import sleep, time

# add two numbers
def add(num1, num2):
	start = time()
	sleep(num1)
	sleep(num2)
	
	return int(time() - start)
```

It is funny and useless but anyway, it works. So I decided to collect codes like that, and this repository is for them.

### Want to contribute?
#### Hell Yeah!
You can submit codes in any programming language(C, C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Assembly, Brainf*ck, Perl, SQL, HTML(_is not a programming language but Github Linguistics still recognizes them, right?_))! Just they should be useless, resource-wasteful, and hilarious. Of course, it would be much better if it is creative or legendary. Just make merge requests today and contribute to this repository!

### Is it good to use the shitty code in your program?
Generally not, it is just for fun. However... there are still lots of companies that measure the internal personnel's ability as lines of codes written by them per day. In these unfortunate cases, you should be inspired to create some shits that exaggerate code lines. To accomplish those missions, this repository would be helpful.
